# 🚀 Cursor AI Website Builder

## Overview

The **Cursor AI Website Builder** is a next-generation web development project that demonstrates how to build a **fully responsive, futuristic website** instantly using **Cursor AI** — without writing a single line of code.  
This project shows how AI can generate complete websites (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) with **one prompt**, leveraging context-based automation and intelligent model selection.

## Key Features

- ⚡ **Build with One Prompt** – Generate a complete website instantly using Cursor AI.  
- 🤖 **AI Agent Integration** – Uses Cursor’s *Agent, Plan, and Ask* features for smart code generation and editing.  
- 🧠 **Context-Aware Design** – Automatically structures content using a well-defined `context.md` file.  
- 🎨 **Futuristic UI** – Includes animations, gradients, and responsive layouts generated by AI.  
- 🧩 **Fully Responsive** – Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- 🔧 **No Coding Required** – Perfect for beginners and creators exploring AI-driven development.  
- 🚀 **Fast & Smart** – Uses optimized prompts for efficient, accurate website creation.

## Technologies Used

- **Cursor AI** – Core AI assistant for coding and automation.  
- **HTML5** – Base structure generated by AI.  
- **CSS3** – AI-styled responsive design with modern gradients and animations.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – For interactivity and functionality.  
- **ChatGPT (for context generation)** – To create and format `context.md` file content.

## Project Structure

```

│
├── index.html # Main AI-generated webpage
├── style.css # Auto-generated stylesheet
├── script.js # Auto-generated JavaScript logic
└── context.md # Project reference file defining design and structure
```

## How It Works

1. **Create `context.md` File** – Define your design inspiration and structure using ChatGPT.  
2. **Format the Context** – Convert it into a clean Markdown file with proper headings and structure.  
3. **Prompt Cursor AI** – Use the command:  
4. **Generate Code** – Cursor creates `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` automatically.  
5. **Preview in Live Server** – Instantly see your complete, responsive, animated website.

## Learning Outcomes
